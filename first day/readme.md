# What it does

Calculate how many trips you need to make to move a given number of boxes with a truck with a given capacity

# How it works

## Simple main class 

The user is prompted the number of boxes and the capacity of the truck used ot move

Then program checks if the input are both positive integers

If both check succeed the program enter a loop till the number of boxes is 0

On each iteration the number of boxes is reduced by the truck capacity unless it is bigger in that
case the number of boxes is set to 0. Then we increase the number to track the number of trip

After the loop is done we print what has been done:
Number of boxes moved by the truck
Which trip that was
Number of boxes remaining
